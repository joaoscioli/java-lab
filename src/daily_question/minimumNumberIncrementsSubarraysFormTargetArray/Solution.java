/// # Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array
///
/// You are given an integer array `target`.
/// You start with an integer array `initial` of the same size, where all elements are initially **0**.
///
/// In one operation, you can choose any **contiguous subarray** from `initial` and increment each
/// element in that subarray by **1**.
///
/// The goal is to determine the **minimum number of operations** required to transform
/// `initial` into `target`.
///
/// ## ğŸ§© Key Insight
/// - Each time `target[i]` is **greater** than `target[i - 1]`, it means new increments must start
///   at index `i`.
/// - Therefore, only **positive increases** between consecutive elements matter.
///
/// The total operations can be computed as:
/// ```java
/// operations = target[0] + Î£(max(target[i] - target[i - 1], 0))
/// ```
///
/// ## ğŸ•’ Time Complexity
/// - **O(n)** â€” single pass through the array.
///
/// ## ğŸ’¾ Space Complexity
/// - **O(1)** â€” constant extra memory.
///
/// ## âœ… Example 1
/// ```java
/// Input:  target = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
/// Output: 3
/// Explanation:
/// [0,0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1,1]
///              -> [1,2,2,2,1]
///              -> [1,2,3,2,1]
/// ```
///
/// ## âœ… Example 2
/// ```java
/// Input:  target = [3, 1, 1, 2]
/// Output: 4
/// Explanation:
/// [0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1]
///             -> [1,1,1,2]
///             -> [2,1,1,2]
///             -> [3,1,1,2]
/// ```
///
/// ## âœ… Example 3
/// ```java
/// Input:  target = [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
/// Output: 7
/// Explanation:
/// [0,0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1,1]
///              -> [2,1,1,1,1]
///              -> [3,1,1,1,1]
///              -> [3,1,2,2,2]
///              -> [3,1,3,3,2]
///              -> [3,1,4,4,2]
///              -> [3,1,5,4,2]
/// ```
///
/// ## Constraints
/// - 1 <= target.length <= 100,000
/// - 1 <= target[i] <= 100,000
