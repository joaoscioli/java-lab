# Binary Number with Alternating Bits

Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.

### Example 1:
````java
Input: n = 5
Output: true
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is: 101
````

### Example 2:
````java
Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: The binary representation of 7 is: 111.
````

### Example 3:
````java
Input: n = 11
Output: false
Explanation: The binary representation of 11 is: 1011.
````

#### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
